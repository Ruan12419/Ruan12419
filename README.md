- Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ruan Lima, I'm 20yo and I am currently studying various IT fields, such as frontend, backend and database programming, I'm also taking a degree as a graphic design technologist, developing skills that can be very well integrated into the programming area, especially in the frontend.


- I'm Very interested in backend development, having started my studies two years ago, I acquired solid knowledge in Java (Spring Boot) and Python (Flask). Java being the main one.
Not limited to just the backend, I also developed knowledge in HTML (Thymeleaf, Jinja2), CSS (Bootstrap 5) and JavaScript (jQuery).

- I consider Java to be my mother language, as it was the first programming language I learned, compared to other languages like Python and C, I got used to Java much better, therefore, it is the main language in which I want to specialize.
